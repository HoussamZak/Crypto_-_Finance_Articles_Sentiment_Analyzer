# Crypto_Finance_Articles_Sentiment_Analyzer Version 2.0 
Improved Sentiment Analysis

Python Bot to Extract -> Summarize -> Analyze Sentiment of Crypto, Finance news articles from Google News.
The end goal is to generate a pie chart to get an idea of the sentiments' spread between Positive, Neutral & Negative.

I improved the code to parse more articles for the given keyword of interest and run deeper analysis.

I will also create a Google Colab file for the ones who would like to run it quickly.
